Here we'll use curated datasets to compute concave hulls to visualise the spatial distribution of Apidae (Bees) and Daviesia (Bitterpeas) and their overlap with burned areas of the Black Summer fires of 2019-2020.*\n\n[Convex and alpha hulls for conservation mapping](https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2022-10-12_alpha-hulls/post.html)<br>\n*Convex hulls and alpha hulls are wonderful alternatives for visualising species distributions when a species has very few existing observations. Here, we will show you how to create these spatial polygons using data from the ALA.*\n\n",
